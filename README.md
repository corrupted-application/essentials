# Essentials

A simple Python module that implements some (maybe) useful features.  
It was originally made for my own use, but I figured someone might find it helpful.

## Usage

### 1. `title`
essentials.title("Title")

**Description:**  
- Changes the window title.

### 2. `clear`
essentials.clear()

**Description:**  
- Clears the console window.

### 3. `version`
essentials.version()

**Description:**  
- Displays the version of `essentials` being run.
